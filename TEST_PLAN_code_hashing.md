# Test Plan for Code Hashing in Memento

## Objective
To ensure comprehensive test coverage for the `code_hash.py` module and verify the accuracy and consistency of code hashing.

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Basic Functionality
- **Description**: Test the hashing of simple functions with no dependencies.
- **Test Cases**:
  - Hashing a function with primitive types as arguments and verifying the hash against a precomputed value.
  - Hashing a function with complex objects as arguments, including custom classes, and ensuring hash consistency.
  - Hashing a function with default arguments and confirming the hash does not change when defaults are used.

### 2. Complex Scenarios
- **Description**: Test the hashing of functions with more complex structures and behaviors.
- **Test Cases**:
  - Hashing nested functions, including closures and lambdas, and ensuring the hash reflects the enclosed scope.
  - Hashing functions that return complex data structures like nested dictionaries and verifying the hash accounts for all nested elements.
  - Hashing functions that utilize external modules and ensuring the hash changes if the external module's version changes.

### 3. Consistency Across Environments
- **Description**: Ensure the hash is consistent across multiple runs and environments.
- **Test Cases**:
  - Hashing the same function multiple times in the same environment and verifying the hash matches.
  - Hashing the same function in different Python versions and comparing the hashes to ensure they are consistent.
  - Hashing the same function on different operating systems and verifying that environmental differences do not affect the hash.

### 4. Edge Cases
- **Description**: Test the hashing of functions with edge cases, including non-standard usage and rare conditions.
- **Test Cases**:
  - Hashing functions that use global variables and ensuring the hash changes if the global state changes.
  - Hashing functions with non-deterministic behaviors like random number generation and ensuring the hash is based on the code, not the output.
  - Hashing functions that interact with the file system and ensuring the hash reflects file content changes.

### 5. Error Handling
- **Description**: Test how code hashing handles functions that raise exceptions or have error flows.
- **Test Cases**:
  - Hashing a function that raises an exception and ensuring the hash is consistent before and after the exception is raised.
  - Hashing a function that handles an exception internally and verifying that different error handling paths produce different hashes.

### 6. Performance
- **Description**: Assess the performance impact of hashing on large codebases and complex functions.
- **Test Cases**:
  - Measuring the time taken to hash a large module and ensuring it is within acceptable performance bounds.
  - Comparing the performance of hashing functions with varying complexities and ensuring performance scales reasonably.

### 7. Integration
- **Description**: Verify that code hashing integrates well with Memento's caching and tracking systems.
- **Test Cases**:
  - Hashing a function and verifying its integration with the caching system, ensuring cache invalidation occurs on hash change.
  - Modifying a function and ensuring the hash changes as expected, and that this triggers the appropriate updates in the tracking system.

### 8. Regression
- **Description**: Check that updates to the hashing algorithm do not unintentionally alter existing hashes.
- **Test Cases**:
  - Hashing a set of functions, updating the hashing algorithm, and rehashing to verify hashes remain consistent or appropriately versioned.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Each scenario must have at least one corresponding test case.
- The test suite should achieve close to 100% coverage for the `code_hash.py` module.
- All tests should pass consistently across supported Python versions and operating systems.

## Timeline
- 1 week for review and analysis.
- 2 weeks for writing tests.
- 1 week for review and refactoring.
- 1 week for integration and regression testing.

## Risks and Mitigations
- Changes to hashing may affect existing data. Implement a versioning system for the hashing algorithm.
- Performance issues with large codebases. Optimize the hashing algorithm and consider asynchronous hashing if needed.

## Documentation
- Update the test documentation to include the new test scenarios and cases.
- Document any changes to the hashing algorithm and their impact on existing hashes.

## Review and Approval
- Code reviews for all new test cases by at least two team members.
- Approval by the project lead before merging into the main branch.
